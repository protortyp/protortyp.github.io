I'm Christian, a senior software engineer at [Helsing
AI](https://helsing.ai), one of Europe's most interesting tech startups.
On this blog, I write about my work and learnings in AI, robotics, angel
investing, and engineering leadership.

I previously co-founded some companies, among them:

- Sensus: AI-powered diagnostic and **reporting** for endoscopic
  procedures  (failed, 2023)
- Protor: Vulnerability analysis as a service (successful exit, 2019-2022)
- DAEX (Decentralized Asset EXchange): Tokenized real estate investments
  on the blockchain (failed, 2018)
- CBT: No-code website builder (successful exit, 2011-2015)

My Bachelor focused on cyber security. I went to Technical University of
Munich to get a Master's degree in Computer Science. I wrote my thesis
at Harvard Medical School on using *Multimodal Mixture of Experts*
approaches in digital pathology.

Currently I am doing a lot of work on Reinforcement Learning,
massively-scalable simulation environments, and robotics.
